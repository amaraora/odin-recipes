        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A whole roasted chicken with golden skin placed on a plate. It looks juicy and well cooked, ready to be served.</p>
      


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
                <li><strong>Celery:</strong> Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2> 
            <ol>
                <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
                <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
                <li>tuff the cavity with celery.</li>
                <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
