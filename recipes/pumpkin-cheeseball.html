        <p>A cheese ball made to look like a pumpkin and served with crackers. It looks creamy and fun, great for a party or snack.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon bottled hot pepper sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 cups finely shredded yellow Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 stem from a bell pepper</li>
                <li>crackers for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Combine cream cheese, hot pepper sauce, paprika, and garlic in a food processor. Process until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese and process until cheese is finely chopped but still very visible.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of the remaining shredded cheese into a 4-inch pile on a large piece of plastic wrap, and top with a rounded scoop of the cheese ball mixture.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the cheese ball mound with the remaining shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Pull sides of plastic wrap up and over the cheese ball mixture to wrap tightly and shape into a ball. (If needed, wrap with an additional piece of plastic wrap to ensure the mixture is very tightly wrapped.)</li>
                <li>Wrap 4 wide rubber bands around the cheese ball, evenly spacing them to create the indentations that are found on a pumpkin. (Depending on the size of the rubber bands, you may need to double wrap each one to create indentations that are deep enough.)</li>
            </ol>
